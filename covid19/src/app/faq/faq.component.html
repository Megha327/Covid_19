                <p>WHO is continuously monitoring and responding to this outbreak.
                     This Q&A will be updated as more is known about COVID-19, 
                     how it spreads and how it is affecting people worldwide.

                <h3>What is coronavirus?</h3>
                <p>Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses which may cause 
                  illness in animals or humans.  In humans, several coronaviruses
                  are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common
                  cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory 
                  Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). 
                  The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus 
                  disease COVID-19.

                <h3>What is COVID-19?</h3>
                <p>COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently 
                    discovered coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown 
                    before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.

                <h3>What are the symptoms of COVID-19?</h3>
                <p>The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and 
                    dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal 
                    congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms 
                    are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected 
                    but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people 
                    (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special 
                    treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes 
                    seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and 
                    those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, 
                    heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious 
                    illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should 
                    seek medical attention.

                <h3>How does COVID-19 spread?</h3>
                <p>People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. 
                    The disease can spread from person to person through small 
                    droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person 
                    with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. These droplets land on objects 
                    and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 
                    by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, 
                    nose or mouth. People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in 
                    droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales 
                    droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter 
                    (3 feet) away from a person who is sick.
                </p>
                <p>
                    WHO is assessing ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share updated findings.

                <h3>Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?</h3>
                <p>Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is 
                    mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets 
                    rather than through the air.  See previous answer on “How does 
                    COVID-19 spread?”

            <div class="row row-inner">
                <h3>Is covid-19 is same as SARS?</h3>
                <p>No. The virus that causes COVID-19 and the one that
                     caused the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory 
                     Syndrome (SARS) in 2003 are related to each other 
                     genetically, but the diseases they cause are quite 
                     different.
                  </p>
                  <p>      
                SARS was more deadly but much less infectious than 
                COVID-19. There have been no outbreaks of SARS anywhere 
                in the world since 2003.

                <h3>Is the source of the coronavirus causing COVID-19 known?</h3>
                <p>Currently, the source of SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus (CoV) 
                    causing COVID-19 is unknown. All available evidence suggests 
                    that SARS-CoV-2 has a natural animal origin and is not a 
                    constructed virus. SARS-CoV-2 virus most probably has its 
                    ecological reservoir in bats. SARS-CoV-2, belongs to a group 
                    of genetically related viruses, which also include SARS-CoV and 
                    a number of other CoVs isolated from bats populations. MERS-CoV 
                    also belongs to this group, but is less closely related.

                <h3>Is COVID-19 airborne?</h3>
                <p>The virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through droplets 
                    generated when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or speaks. These
                     droplets are too heavy to hang in the air. They quickly fall on floors
                      or surfaces. 
                </p>
                <p>       
                    You can be infected by breathing in the virus if you are within 1 metre
                     of a person who has COVID-19, or by touching a contaminated surface and then touching
                      your eyes, nose or mouth before washing your hands.
